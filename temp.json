    "description": "The total value of top 75 Indian brands had dropped by six percent in 2020 versus 2019 due to slowdown in the brand value of companies in the banking and automotive categories. ",
    "article": "The top 75 brands in India have rebounded to a combined worth of $393 billion, averaging a35 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2020, when the pandemic struck, driving their value to downhill. Topping the rankings this year are   (TCS) with brand value of $45,519 million, followed by   and Infosys at $32,747 million and $29,223 million, respectively, according to the Kantar Brandz 2022 report. The total value of the top 75 Indian brands had dropped 6 percent in 2020 over 2019 due to a drop in the brand value of companies in the banking and automotive sectors. There is a rebound effect compared to 2020. And then there is growth of tech brands including the B2B (business to business) technology category that includes brands like TCS and Infosys, which is now close to 24 percent of our total valuation, and then there is consumer tech that includes Swiggy,   brands which is 11 percent. Both these categories combined have added to the growth, Soumya Mohanty, managing director, insights division, Kantar, a data analytics and brand consulting firm, told Moneycontrol. She said that the growth rate of the top 75 most valuable Indian brands outpaced that of other major international markets. Technology has seen the highest growth as a category and is one-third of our total valuation. Globally, tech is the driver of growth in overall valuation and there are three countries in the world where technology comprises a significant part of the total valuation. One is the US, then China and India. India is now higher than China in percentage contribution of technology to the total valuation, said Mohanty. She added that TCS is the new number one and has displaced HDFC Bank, which currently ranks second with a brand value of $32.7 billion. HDFC Bank had held the top position since the first ranking was unveiled in 2014. TCS is also one of the brands that has entered the global top 100 most valuable brands ranking and along with Infosys has seen maximum growth in brand value, Mohanty added. The top 10 most valuable Indian brands contribute over half of the rankings total value and there has been significant movement at the top in addition to the two most valuable brands switching positions, the Kantar report said.  with a brand value of $13.6 billion has risen four places to rank sixth. We have 14 new entrants across 11 categories and there are about 11 startups and the number of startups has increased year-on-year. More startups are entering because they are disrupting the market and have headroom to grow. Also, some of the large ad spenders are startups unlike traditional brands which tend to go dark whenever there is an issue. So they (startups) are investing behind brand building. This is what is helping the startups to grow, said Mohanty. Brand value of the startups category has increased from $23 billion in 2020 to $44 billion in 2022. Edtech and foodtech are the big segments in the startup space and the pandemic has played a role in increasing their brand value. But that is where we have to see how the change in behaviour is going to impact them. With education, we need to be careful because during the pandemic even younger children were taking online courses, which may change a bit. So education is wait and watch, while food delivery is here to stay, she added. Indias leading brands have grown despite global economic headwinds, and putting the disruption from COVID-19 behind them, said Deepender Rana, executive managing director, South Asia, insights division, Kantar."

The announcement would make loan repayment linked to BPLR costlier. The current BPLR rate is 12.75 per cent. It was revised last in June. \"Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) revised as 13.45 per cent per annum with effect from September 15, 2022,\" the SBI posted on its website. The bank has also raised the base rate by similar basis points to 8.7 per cent, effective Thursday. The EMI amount for the borrowers who have taken loans at the base rate would go up. These are the old benchmarks on which banks used to disburse loans. Now most of the banks provide loans on the External Benchmark Based Lending Rate (EBLR) or the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR). The bank revises both the BPLR and the base rate on a quarterly basis. The lending rate revision by the SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come. The increase in the benchmark lending rates comes weeks ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy meeting, which is again expected to hike rates to tame inflation."

    "article": "Domestic passenger vehicle sales could touch a record level of nearly 40 lakh units this year on strong demand and companies finding ways to enhance production despite semiconductor shortage, a senior   official said on Monday. Even as the chip shortage issue has improved compared to a year back, the industry is estimated to have a pending order of around 7.5lakhunits of passenger vehicles withMarutiSuzuki India (MSI) alone having around 4.18lakhunits, company Senior Executive Officer, Marketing and Sales,ShashankSrivastavatold PTI here. ''I think it would be slightly below 4 million (units mark). At the moment the projections are that in January-September, maybe we should be touching like 2.8 or 2.9 million,'' he said when asked about the sales prospects of passenger vehicles (PVs) in the domestic market in 2022. He further said,''In three months time, that is October, November, December - if we get let's say one million more, then we should be around that 3.8 to 3.9 million units.'' This,Srivastavasaid would be a record for a calendar year. The previous best was recorded in 2018 with 33,94,712 units followed by 32,29,672 units in 2017 and 30,82,421 units 2021. One of the key factors for such a record this year, he said, is that the economy is back on the growth path. ''There is a big correlation between vehicle sales and economic growth. The economic growth is projected to be 7 per cent plus after two years of not so good growth because of COVID-19,''Srivastavaadded. Also, he said due to the pandemic, there was an increase in demand for personal mobility but companies were unable to supply due to the semiconductor shortage challenges and order kept cumulated. For MSI alone,Srivastavasaid the current pending booking is at 4.18lakhunits and for the industry it is estimated to be around 7.5lakhunits. The company's vehicles such as theErtiga,Brezza,Balenoand the XL6 continue to have long waiting periods, extending up to six months, he said adding new SUVGrand Vitara, for which the price is yet to be announced, has already received around 52,000 bookings out of which nearly 25,000 are for strong hybrid variant. ''So, as the semiconductor issue eases and production increases, those vehicles can be immediately sent out,'' he added. A third factor for increase in sales is also a good traction in almost all segments, some of which had stopped during the peak of the pandemic. ''For example, fleet or taxis, those segments also have started coming back again as the rate of COVID-19 starts to taper down,''Srivastavaadded. Asked about the current impact of semiconductor shortage on Maruti's production, he said, ''While we have increased the production level and is going up all the time, the current issues are model specific.'' He further said, ''For the domestic market we are doing 94-95 per cent of capacity.'' On the outlook of chip availability,Srivastavasaid there is a limited visibility of semiconductor supply going forward."

    "article": "The auto component industry should focus on enhancing localisation, improving manufacturing quality and keep investing in emerging technologies for a sustainable growth,  Executive Chairman Kenichi Ayukawa said on Wednesday. Speaking at the 62nd session annual session of ACMA here, Ayukawa, who is also the president of auto industry body SIAM, noted that localisation is necessary to ensure growth of the auto component industry. \"We have to go much deeper and find ways to localise smallest of the components, including raw material, wherever possible,\" he said. The industry should also focus on improving and sustaining higher levels of quality, he said. \"Indian auto industry has gained a large scale, both in the domestic market and exports. At this big scale, quality holds a very high significance. Any small mistake exports. Any small mistake can be harmful not only for the industry but for the brand 'Make in India',\" he noted. Investing in new futuristic technologies is another area which the auto component industry should consider, Ayukawa said. \"Prime Minister has committed a target of net zero carbon emission by 2070 and 45 per cent reduction by 2030. In our journey of de-carbonisation to achieve 2070 and 45 per cent reduction by 2030 these targets, industry should put efforts and invest in all feasible futuristic technologies,\" he said, Ayukawa also asked the industry to keep investing in the core businesses. \"I always tell my supplier partners at Maruti Suzuki, that re-investing in the core business is very important. It not only strengthens your financials but also improves your ability to deal with challenges,\" he stated. Ayukawa said SIAM and ACMA should collaborate and put significant efforts to bring back and sustain the growth of the industry. ACMA President Sunjay Kapur, at the event, said that while passenger and commercial vehicle sales have returned to the pre-pandemic levels, two-wheeler sales are expected to rebound in the festive season."

    "article": "Businesses need to be prepared for possibilities of a continued or higher inflation and deflation of commodity prices in next 2-3 years,   CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta said on Tuesday. The unprecedented inflation is not homegrown but has been caused by several global factors, including supply chain disruption due to the pandemic and Ukraine-Russia war, he said while speaking at the FICCI LEADS 2022 event here. \"It is very difficult to predict but I think where we have to be ready with is possible three scenarios in the world today,\" Mehta said when asked about his thoughts on the possibility of inflation coming down in the near future. One possibility is, he said, \"the inflation or a slight deflation will continue at a moderated pace from the elevated base today. The second is it could go up even further and the third is there could be a deflation in commodity prices.\" \"This is a horizon I'm looking at for the next two, three years and as businesses, we have to be ready for each of the three scenarios.\" Mehta said a big difference in the elevated levels of inflation this time is that earlier it used to be in one or two commodities but \"this time, it has been across a range of commodities. That is the reason why it's become a massive global issue\". The wholesale price-based inflation had eased to 11-month low of 12.41 per cent in August, on softening in prices of manufactured and fuel products, even as food items remained expensive. Although the WPI-based inflation declined for three consecutive months, it remained in double digit for 17 months beginning April last year. The inflation was 13.93 per cent in July and 11.64 per cent in August last year. It had touched a record high of 15.88 per cent in May this year. Global supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19, the huge amount of fiscal spending, especially in many developed world, and the war in Ukraine and its impact on energy prices are the main reasons for high inflation, he added. Mehta said every country is looking at energy security and an increase in production could have a dampening effect on inflation."

    "article": " has for the first time sold oil through a three-month local tender, commanding $5-$8 per barrel more than existing rates under new rules that allow producers marketing freedom, industry sources said. ONGC, the country's top oil explorer, accepted bids at that level through auction of light sweet oil from its western offshore field, including supplies from the country's flagship Mumbai High fields, they said. In June India abolished a rule that said oil from blocks awarded prior to 1999 must be sold to government-nominated customers, mostly state refiners. That meant producers such as ONGC and Oil India often sold oil from those blocks at below market rates. ONGC had offered 33 lots of 412,500 barrels each - 26 cargoes from Uran and seven cargoes from Mumbai offshore - for sale starting Nov. 1 at minimum 50-cent premium over the average monthly price of Brent, according to a tender document seen by Reuters. Western offshore assets, including the Mumbai High fields, account for about 70% of ONGC's annual output of nearly 20 million tonnes, or roughly 400,000 bpd. All the cargoes were sold to state refiners except one, which was awarded to Reliance Industries Ltd, sources said. State refiner Hindustan Petroleum bought 15 cargoes; Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals bought five; and Bharat Petroleum Corp was the highest bidder for three, the sources said. Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, got one cargo while its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Crop was awarded eight, the sources said. Indian refiners bid to pay a premium of $1.80-$1.85 per barrel for cargoes from Uran, where supplies come through a pipeline, $3.8-$6.5 per barrel for offshore cargoes and about $1.55 per barrel for a parcel from Panna Mukta field, they said. Uran cargoes fetch a lower premium as local levies make the crude costlier than offshore supplies. Sources said ONGC hopes to get better participation in subsequent tenders. None of the companies involved responded to Reuters' requests for comments."

    "description": "For the quarter, growth in hydropower generation stood at 14 percent while that in thermal and renewable energy stood at 2.5 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis.",
    "article": "Power sector companies are likely to report strong numbers for the quarter ended June 2022 on the back of a 5 percent on-year (YoY) growth in demand. The daily peak demand during the quarter was also higher by 4 percent on year. Indias power consumption grew by 13.3 percent on an annualised basis to 127.4 billion units (BU) in September 2022 and 11.65 percent during the first six months of this financial year. Electricity generation was higher for both the public sector and private players while distribution companies reported sales that were substantially higher, which should show up in higher revenues. Experts believe that demand for as well as consumption of electricity will increase further due to the festival season and improvement in economic activity with the ministry of power expecting peak demand to touch 215 GW (gigawatts). July and August saw low generation growth due to heavy rains but September saw about 11 percent generation growth over the previous year, with hydropower generation going up by 24 percent and thermal 9 percent. For the quarter, growth in hydropower generation stood at 14 percent, with thermal and renewable energy posting a growth in generation of 2.5 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, on a YoY basis. According to a report from Emkay Research, coal production reported a YoY growth of 11 percent for the quarter and an on-year growth of 20 percent for the first six months of the current fiscal. Coal dispatches were up 5 percent YoY for the quarter and up 8 percent for H1FY23. As of end-September (i.e. till 29 Sep), coal inventory at domestic coal-based plants stood at 24MT, which is up 2.4x since clocking 10MT in Sep-21, when a sudden spike in generation pushed up coal demand, said the report from Emkay Research. International coal prices remained at elevated levels in Q2FY23 and given the various events and situations surrounding Europe and gas prices, analysts at ICICI Securities expect prices to remain high in FY23. Australian and South African thermal coal prices were more than $ 300 per tonne for the whole quarter while Indonesian coal prices moderated slightly to $170 per tonne. However, JKM (Japan Korea Marker) LNG (liquefied natural gas) prices again increased towards the end of September to more than $50 per MMBtu (metric million British thermal units). The higher prices of coal and gas will likely impact the profitability of Indian power companies on a sequential basis.  It is likely to see a generation growth of 8-9 percent on-year, along with realisation growth of 12 percent. During Q2FY23, generation for NTPC (standalone) grew by ~9 percent YoY, which is far better than the total Indian thermal generation growth of 2.5 percent YoY, said analysts at Emkay Research. Generation from NTPCs key subsidiaries/joint ventures grew by 34 percent YoY on the back of higher capacity and improved plant load factor (PLF). However, experts expect input cost growth is likely to remain ahead of realisation, which will lead to about 8 percent YoY growth in profit after tax (PAT) growth for NTPC. - The company has plans to foray into the smart metering infra business, where it will invest in smart meter asset development business as floated by the respective state utilities. Power Grid aspires to be present across the value chain, wherein it will set up the required infrastructure and manage operations and maintenance business as well. Power Grid is expected to grab a significant portion of the tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) opportunity of ~Rs 30,000 core over the next six months, said a report from ICICI Securities. The brokerage expects the companys Q2FY23 consolidated recurring PAT to increase 10.1 percent YoY on the back of Rs 11,000 crore trailing 12 months asset capitalisation. - Prices of imported coal are up over 7 percent quarter-on-quarter and +128 percent annually, leading to improved coal profitabilityfrom the companys Indonesian mines. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect higher imported coal prices to lead to improved profitability while performance in the generation segment is likely to remain on the regular course with losses likely to come down in Mundra. According to a report from ICICI Securities, the companys renewables and distribution business makes it the best private player in the sector and expects the companys adjusted PAT to increase 67 percent YoY to Rs 680 crore for the quarter. - Coal India will continue to benefit from higher volumes due to import substitution as well as higher prices for e-auction sales. Analysts at ICICI Securities estimate Coal Indias Q2FY23 PAT to grow 102 percent YoY to Rs 5,900 crore mainly due to a 4.7 percent YoY growth in offtake to 154 million tonnes and 16.7 percent YoY increase in average realisation to Rs 1,689 per tonne. Among other players, owing to seasonality, the hydro plants of and are likely to report strong PLFs basis which the PAT for JSW is likely to increase by 25 percent on year and NHPC is likely to see a moderate growth of 3 percent."

    "article": "The oil and gas sector is staring at material damage to its profitability in the September quarter owing to government imposed taxes, shrinking global refining margins and losses for fuel retailers. Oil and gas companies under coverage at ICICI Securities are pegged to report a 32 percent year-on-year decline in operating profits for the September quarter while their earnings are set to slide 76 percent from the year-ago quarter. While the sector reported strong earnings growth in the previous quarter, the governments imposition of special excise duties on crude oil production as well as export of crude oil products have weighed on the performance. For state-owned oil marketing companies, the limited ability to pass on higher oil prices to consumers will mean that they continue to suffer heavy marketing losses alongwith a decline in refining margins, which had an offsetting in the June quarter. Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expects operating profits of upstream oil and gas companies to shrink 37-40 percent sequentially owing to 11-12 percent lower realization on the crude oil sold by them as compared to the June quarter. Further, the  will also reduce average realization of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation by as much as $28 per barrel in the September quarter on a sequential basis. We expect volumes to remain muted, in line with recent trends, Kotak Equities said in its preview note. For the oil marketing companies, the continued lack of reflection of higher spot crude oil prices on pump prices are likely lead to  . The three OMCs IOCL, BPCL & HPCL remain trapped in the quagmire of weak marketing losses and there is not enough traction in GRMs, said ICICI Securities. Gross refining margins for state-owned refiners is likely to slump 5.6-15.9 per barrel on a sequential basis with the state-owned refiners likely to report net losses of Rs 21,270 crore, ICICI Securities said."

With this launch, M&M has notched up the competition in the affordable e-SUV segment in India, which is currently ruled by Tata Nexon EV (Tata recorded 87% EV market share in FY22). XUV400 comes with a battery pack of 39.4 kWh, similar to Nexon EV Maxs 40.5 kWh. However, compared to 437km range in a single charge from a slightly bigger battery pack in Nexon EV Max, XUV400s battery offers a longer range of 456km  owing to better technology. M&M believes, there remains a vast electric opportunity in the C-segment (4-4.5m), contrasting to Tata Nexon EVs presence in the B-segment (3.85-4m, Nexon EV has 3.5% share in this segment).

Coal India Ltd (CIL) accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic coal output. \"Due to COVID our earlier target has been postponed. We will fulfil our dream of one billion tonne and we will be aatmanirbhar in thermal coal...By 2025-26, Coal India will produce one billion tonne,\" Joshi said on the sidelines of a function here. CIL was earlier eying 1 billion tonne coal production by 2023-24. Replying to a question, he said as far as thermal power plants are concerned, there is an average coal stock of 24 million tonne and day-to-day stock of the fossil fuel is adding. \"Our plan is to keep at least 40 million tonne of coal as far as March 31 is concerned,\" he said. Coal output by CIL in current financial year is expected to be 700 MT and there would be additional output of 200 MT from other sources. While addressing a function organised by CIL here to sign memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with five PSUs for coal gasification projects, the minister said in the next few months India will become self reliant in thermal coal production. There would be an investment of Rs 30,000 crore in all the five projects. \"We have kept the arrangement of PLI scheme. The size of PLI (production-linked incentive) would be around Rs 6,000 crore,\" the minister noted. For setting up large-scale coal-to-chemical projects through surface coal gasification route, CIL signed three separate MoUs with BHEL, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) and GAIL (India) Ltd. In addition, NLC India is signing MoU with BHEL."

    "article": "Fiat Chrysler received a second chance to permanently block U.S. sales of redesigned Roxor off-road vehicles made by Indian carmaker   Ltd, which is fighting claims that it copied Fiat Chrysler's Jeep design. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that a Detroit federal court applied the wrong standard when it found that Mahindra's post-2020 Roxors were unlikely to cause consumer confusion. A spokesperson for Mahindra said it was confident that the outcome of the case will be \"consistent with the previous rulings\" in its favor. Fiat Chrysler's parent company Stellantis NV declined to comment on the decision. Fiat Chrysler sued Mahindra in Michigan court and at the U.S. International Trade Commission in 2018 over its Roxor design, arguing it copied trademark-protected elements of its Jeeps. A Detroit federal court blocked Mahindra from selling pre-2020 Roxors, but rejected its bid to block sales of its redesigned version of the off-road-only vehicle. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain's decision was based on an ITC ruling that the Roxor did not infringe Fiat Chrysler's trademark rights because the average person would \"know immediately\" from looking at it that it is not a Jeep. But the 6th Circuit said Monday that the court should have held Mahindra to a higher standard because it was already a known infringer. Mahindra's new design was required to keep a \"safe distance\" from Jeep designs, U.S. Circuit Judge Helene White wrote for a three-judge panel. \"Because a court can enjoin even a non-infringing product under the safe-distance rule, the simple fact that a known infringer's redesigned product is non-infringing does not support the conclusion that the safe-distance rule should not apply,\" White said. The appeals court sent the case back for the Detroit court to consider whether the new Roxors kept a \"safe distance\" from the Jeep design. The case is Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd v. FCA US LLC, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-2605."

    "article": "Our update released on 6th July22 (link) had covered merger related aspects like liabilities glide path, asset mix, regulatory requirements and profitability. Discussions with investors on this merger update brought to light certain queries, following which we met HDFCB management to allay these concerns viz. 1) garnering higher market share in system deposits, 2) grandfathering of HDFCs bank borrowings, 3) share of unsecured loans in the merged entity, 4) drag on NIM due to PSL shortfall and 5) outlook on NIM/opex. We believe that faster deposit accretion for HDFCB from a system standpoint may be achievable, while grandfathering of bank borrowings may be permitted. Unsecured share in the merged entity might remain between 11-12%, as mortgage portfolio (higher ticket size) would grow aggressively. Standalone NIM may gradually improve (4.2% in FY22), as share of retail would rise that may also protect NIM owing to lower PSL requirements. Opex could remain elevated over the medium term.

    "description": "Emkay Global Financial is bullish on HDFC Bank has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1800 in its research report dated October 04, 2022.",
    "article": "HDFCB maintained its robust credit growth trajectory  up 23.5% YoY/6% QoQ, in Q2 (vs 21.5% YoY/2% QoQ, in Q1). This was mainly led by continued strong momentum in commercial banking (31.5% YoY/9.5% QoQ)/corporate book (27% YoY /9% QoQ). Retail growth too was healthy, at 21.5% YoY/5% QoQ. Mortgage book purchase from HDFC continued to be high at Rs91.5bn in Q2 (vs Rs95bn in Q1). As per our channel checks, vehicle financing too is showing signs of pick up and will, thus, be a key monitorable for the bank (being the leader in the space). Deposit growth was also strong, at 19% YoY, with retail deposit growth at 20% YoY; CASA growth stood at 15% YoY, which led to a slight decline in CASA ratio to 45%. We believe strong growth in the non-retail book coupled with some slip-up in CASA ratio should keep margins and, thereby, core profitability in check. After a slight surge in Q1, we expect the bank to report sequential improvement in headline NPAs during Q2, led by better recovery in the agri portfolio (including KCC) and accelerated credit growth. With the bank sitting on healthy, specific + contingent provisions, we expect LLP to moderate which should, thereby, support net profitability. We believe HDFCB will be the key beneficiary of the buoyant credit markets, given its strong retail orientation as well as its increasing inclination towards corporate growth. However, a positive regulatory stance on the impending merger structure and managing the merger without much disruption will be key for re-rating. Currently, the stock trades at 2.4x FY24E ABV (ex-subs valuation). We retain our BUY rating on the stock, with TP of Rs1,800/share (3.0x Jun-24E ABV + subs valuation of Rs78), given healthy return ratios, strong capital comfort and reasonable valuations. At 14:46 hrs HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,440.95, down Rs 11.65, or 0.80 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,462.10 and an intraday low of Rs 1,439.45. It was trading with volumes of 63,036 shares, compared to its thirty day average of 273,071 shares, a decrease of -76.92 percent. In the previous trading session, the share closed up 2.81 percent or Rs 39.75 at Rs 1,452.60. The share touched its 52-week high Rs 1,724.30 and 52-week low Rs 1,271.75 on 18 October, 2021 and 17 June, 2022, respectively. Currently, it is trading 16.43 percent below its 52-week high and 13.3 percent above its 52-week low. Market capitalisation stands at Rs 802,603.25 crore. "

The synergy and simplification strategy is aimed at improving scale and cash flows, sources told The Economic Times.

This consolidation is part of Tata group chairman N Chandrasekarans plan to make the conglomerate future ready and the process is expected to take place over the coming months, the sources said, adding that fewer companies would also rationalise management time and effort. Tata group at present has 29 listed companies, besides nearly 60 unlisted ones and hundreds of subsidiaries, spread across 10 sectors. Tata Sons did not respond to queries, the report added. Earlier this week, it was reported that Tata group has started an exercise to AirAsia India and Vistara under Air India. It is understood that the plan is to merge AirAsia India into Air India Express over one year, and to bring all of the group's airlines under the Air India umbrella by 2024.

This was just the beginning and one day the Eknath Shinde-led Maharashtra government might even \"trade Mumbai,\" said the editorial in the Sena mouthpiece \"Saamana\". Before this, an international finance centre (which eventually took shape as Gujarat International Finance Tech- GIFT City) was shifted to Gujarat from Mumbai, the editorial alleged. A blame-game has begun in Maharashtra following the announcement two days ago that the joint venture semiconductor project of the Indian conglomerate Vedanta and Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, proposed to be set up near Pune earlier, will come up in Gujarat. Without naming the BJP, the Sena mouthpiece alleged that like this project, some people also harbour the desire to \"conquer\" Mumbai-Thane and undermine Maharashtra's prosperity. This was the reason a puppet chief minister was installed in Maharashtra, Saamana alleged. When BJP's Devendra Fadnavis was chief minister from 2014-19, the GIFT City project was handed over to Gujarat, and current CM Eknath Shinde similarly allowed the semiconductor plant to slip away, it claimed. Tomorrow they will not hesitate to even trade Mumbai. Foxconn is a start, the editorial said."

    "description": "Pent-up demand continues to propel auto stocks, while rising interest rates auger well for financials. However, the anticipated global slowdown is spoiling the party for IT and metal companies",
    "article": "Shares of financial and automobile companies continue to hog the limelight in the Indian equity market as the rising interest rate regime auger well for the financial sector and the auto sector ride on pent-up demand and easing of supply chain pressure. Indian auto companies have launched a slew of models both in the ICE (internal combustion engines) as well as EV (electric vehicle) segment which have been accepted well and there are strong bookings. It is not surprising then that the companies from these two sectors have witnessed the highest number of upgrades from the sell-side analysts over the past one year. This is as per the data sourced from Bloomberg. Bloomberg tracks recommendations of sell-side analysts regularly. But sharing of reports and recommendation is voluntary; to that extent it is not fully representative of the market. Like in August,  , the maker of iconic Royal Enfield motorcycles, continues to attract both customers as well as analysts to its counters. Its recent launches have been successful and well accepted, while its older models continue to see strong demand. The companies joint venture with Volvo, the Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles has been performing well as the demand for commercial vehicles and buses in the country is now on an uptrend. Consequently, as many as 35 analystsand brokerages have a buy rating for the stock as at the end of September 2022 compared to just 18 buys a year ago. One of Indias largest private life insurers,  , occupied the second spot amongst the stocks that received the maximum upgrades in the past one year. Its annual premium equivalent (APE) and value of new business (VNB) are showing a healthy growth while the execution of Exide Life Insurance will provide additional tailwinds. As a result, 32 analysts have a buy on this company compared to 27 a year ago. FMCG and cigarette giant  is riding a strong wave across its business segments. The key growth drivers for the company are its focus on de-risking business model by reducing dependence on the core cigarette business (affected by regulatory and tax hurdles) and scaling up FMCG business; ITC Infotech business exhibiting notable potential; PLI linked incentives to help grow Agri business & drive exports and its high dividend yield and reasonable valuations compared to peers, Axis Securities said in a note. The Kolkata-based company occupied the third spot as it now has 35 buys compared to 28 a year ago. Riding the auto theme, the other two big companies from the space    and  - also received the most number of buy calls.  , which is also the biggest Indian company by market capitalization along with the jewellery maker,   occupied the fifth and sixth spots. Reliance Industries received the most upgrades in the last one quarter driven by its renewable energy, 5G and retail push. The growth momentum and improved margin profile across the sector will drive RILs revenue growth of 25 percent and EBITDA growth of 32 percent in FY23, said the analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Service. These, however, do not factor in any incremental growth from 5G capex, new energy and other segments. According to a note from Motilal Oswal, Over the next two-to-three years, RIL is likely to create the next engine of growth but it could put pressure on its near-term return ratios. Reliance received 7.2 percent upgrades during the quarter and was followed by ITC Ltd and HDFC Life Insurance for which the upgrades in percentage terms stood at 5.6 and 5.2 percent respectively. The other two companies that received the most rating upgrades during the quarter were Eicher Motors and Titan Company Ltd. Titan is well placed to capitalize on long term growth opportunities led by jewellery share gains due to network expansion, regional thrust and hallmarking benefits; Omni-channel strategy across jewellery, watches and eyewear; new growth drivers like Caratlane, Titan Eye+, Taneira and entry into high growth segments like wearables such as smart watches, over the head headphones and Truly Wireless earphones, research firm Prabhudas Liladhar said in a report. HDFC Life Insurance garnered maximum rating upgrades in the past one month amounting to 5.9 percent growth over the previous month. It was followed by Reliance Industries and Eicher Motors which managed an increase of 2.1 percent each over the month of August 2022.  ,   followed Eicher Motors with close 1 percent jump in buy ratings. According to analysts at Incred Equities, Bajaj Finances digital transformation is visible in the form of superior client addition and improved turnaround time with almost zero manual intervention and, this will result in a gradual improvement in operating leverage and lower credit cost (below ~2%), resulting in superior return ratios. The commodity prices saw their dream run end as the world economy braces for a slowdown. The experts are apprehensive of the demand revival especially in the steel sector and the revival of production in China will be an added negative for Indian steel producers. Consequently,   tops the list of maximum downgrades during the past one year. It saw a 35 percent increase in its downgrades', while Indias largest steel producer,  , saw a reduction of 14.7 percent in its buy calls. At the same time, the uncertainty surrounding the growth of global economy, has also dimmed the prospects of Indian IT companies. The tech giants of India, namely,  ,   and   saw their downgrades increase by 29.8, 18.4 and 16 percent respectively. ,   and   were the other constituents of this list. Britannia topped the list of maximum downgrades during the last quarter as its rating downgrades increased by 16.7 percent. The buy calls on the stock have gone down from 26 three months ago to 20 currently. Despite the company raising prices to offset the commodity price rise, Volume growth acceleration along with improvement in margin will be a tough task in the current challenging environment, a note from HDFC Securities said. Second on the list is the state run ONGC which the ratings downgrades increased by 15 percent in the quarter from 23 buys a quarter ago to 18 now. The hold calls on this navratna company have gone up from 3 to 7 in the past one quarter. The companys overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is facing problems due to the sanctions on Russia. It has three assets in Russia at Sakhalin (20 percent stake), JSC Vankomeft (26 percent stake) and Imperial Energy (100 percent subsidiary). The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war have not only created demand supply constraints but have also affected its overseas subsidiary ONGC Videshs activities in Russia and therefore, taking a cautious view, we lower our rating on the stock to Hold, said a report from Geojit Retail Equity Research. The Indian IT sector is bracing itself for the expected cut down in IT spending by the global organisations in the wake of rising interest rates and increased monetary tightening. Tech Mahindra, one of the top 5 IT services providers is expected to feel pressure on its margins in the near to medium term which has resulted in an increase in its downgrade and hold ratings while the buy calls have gone down by 14 percent in the past one quarter. Apart from energy and technology stocks which have received maximum downgrades over the past one month, there is a surprise inclusion at the top of the list. Two wheeler major,   has seen its downgrades increase the most by 3.7 percent over the past one month. The company is facing strong headwinds in its major exports market of Africa where a sharp devaluation of Naira is hurting demand in a big way. Africa contributes 53 percent of its exports. The governments proposal of putting a blanket ban on motorcycles in Nigeria, although difficult to implement, remains a key concern, HDFC Securities Institutional Research said in a note. BPCL and JSW Steel saw their downgrades increase by more than 3 percent during the past one month while the IT major,   joined the list at number four. It saw one buy call getting downgraded to sell while the hold on the stock remained unchanged. Apart from Infosys from the technology pack, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies also saw their buy calls slipping into sell."

He also shared his estimates and opinions regarding volume expectations for the upcoming festive season and post the festive season. He sounded very optimistic about the future prospects of the company. He opined that RE has successfully plugged the product portfolio gap by introducing the Hunter 350 and has extended its reach to those customers, which it was not catering to earlier. He acknowledged that the Hunter 350 is attracting higher interest from the younger set of customers and first-time buyers besides addressing the affordability concerns. He also stated that the Hunter 350 is cannibalising volume of the Classic 350 and Meteor to the extent of ~40%. But, he felt that the Hunter 350 will add an incremental volume of ~10k-15k/month. He added that the Hunter 350 has also attracted interest from the customers of Bajaj Pulsar, TVS Apache and Jawa due to an array of features and aggressive pricing. Overall competitive intensity remains low in the segment. He stated that overall bookings for the Hunter 350 across the country are ~70k while production capacity stands at ~18k/month. He also hinted at a strong new model pipeline from RE over the next 6-12 months. The interaction also reinforced our positive stance on the company, which we have highlighted in our note. We continue to remain upbeat about volume growth from RE in both domestic as well as exports market. Despite the rising share of lower margin products, we dont see a major impact on profitability on the back of improving utilization and moderating commodity costs. We are thus building in Revenue/EBITDA/EPS CAGR of 19%/32%/31% over FY22-25E. However, after the recent run-up in the Eicher stock, we see limited upside potential. We maintain ACCUMULATE on Eicher. We are keeping our estimates unchanged. We are valuing REs standalone business at 28x Sept24E EPS (26x earlier) and VECV at 12x EV/EBITDA on Sept24E to arrive at a target price (TP) of Rs3,918. At 16:01 hrs Eicher Motors was quoting at Rs 3,673.85, up Rs 49.05, or 1.35 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 3,693.90 and an intraday low of Rs 3,582.95. It was trading with volumes of 18,294 shares, compared to its thirty day average of 36,413 shares, a decrease of -49.76 percent.

The share touched its 52-week high Rs 3,785.80 and 52-week low Rs 2,110.00 on 21 September, 2022 and 07 March, 2022, respectively. Currently, it is trading 2.96 percent below its 52-week high and 74.12 percent above its 52-week low. Market capitalisation stands at Rs 100,466.85 crore.  "

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for meeting two-thirds of the Rs 75 crore project cost. \"Under the aegis of the NTCA and powered by IOC, the ambitious Cheetah Reintroduction Project is set to welcome the first Cheetahs on Indian soil after over seven decades on September 17, 2022,\" the company said in a statement. IOC is the first and only corporate to come forward to support 'Project Cheetah' through CSR. Under this project, a source population of 15-20 Cheetahs will be flown in from Namibia and South Africa and will be introduced at Kuno National Park, Madhya Pradesh. IOC will be contributing Rs 50.22 crore over five years for cheetah reintroduction as well as its habitat management and protection, ecology development, staff training and veterinary healthcare. The cheetah population in India dwindled during the 19th century, largely because of bounty hunting by local kings and ruling British officials. The last three Asiatic cheetahs were hunted down in 1948 and the cheetah was declared extinct in the country in 1952. The subspecies of cheetah which got extinct in India was Asiatic Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) and the subspecies being introduced in the country is the African Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus). Research has shown that the genes of these two subspecies are the same. On August 2, IOC said it had signed an MoU with NTCA for the transcontinental relocation of Cheetah in its historical range in India. The MoU was signed by S M Vaidya, Chairman, IOC and S P Yadav, Addl. Director General (Project Tiger) and Member Secretary (NTCA)."

India had planned to set up a $50 billion mega refinery on the west coast but the project didn't take off despite backing from state-run oil companies and investment commitment from the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The project has been stalled since 2018 due to disputes over land acquisition. \"When an opportunity like this is missed, it is very regrettable. We need to try and revive the project. We have sent feelers all around,\" Puri said. The mega refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex project was first announced in 2015; it was slated to be the biggest in Asia. State run-refining and marketing companies  ,   and   came together to form a new entity to set up the project, namely Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. The project faced challenges, first with land acquisition and then from local citizens who protested against it due to concerns over its impact on the environment. In 2019, Shiv Sena, which was against the project, pushed its alliance partner in the state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to shelve the project. Since then, the political alliance broke and the state has seen two governments Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition government and now the Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led BJP-Shiv Sena government. I have the bandwidth now (to revive the project). I have reasonable confidence that the current government will show enthusiasm, Puri said."

    "article": "We believe IndusInd Bank is coming out of a tough cycle and concerns about asset quality, liquidity amid COVID-19 pandemic for bank is fading away, as collection efficiencies (due to recovery in core portfolio CV/MFIs) and liquidity position (LCR ~124%) is improving over the past few quarters. Bank reported credit cost at 3.8%/3.0% during FY21-22, but accelerated provisions made in past few quarters (in turn maintaining healthy provisioning on stressed assets) and additional non-NPA provision buffer of 1.2% of loans will enable a sharp drop in credit cost and would drive strong earnings recovery. Its credit cost is expected to fall sharply to ~150 bps annually over FY23-25E. With a view to strengthen its liability franchise, bank has been improving the granularity of its deposit book. Retail deposits share rose from ~26% in FY2019 to ~41% in FY2022. At CMP, IIB trades at 1.6x and 1.4x its FY2023E/FY2024E BV. We maintain Buy with a revised TP of Rs. 1,400. At 16:01 hrs IndusInd Bank was quoting at Rs 1,140.35, down Rs 24.05, or 2.07 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,162.95 and an intraday low of Rs 1,132.80. It was trading with volumes of 122,313 shares, compared to its thirty day average of 237,969 shares, a decrease of -48.60 percent.

    "article": "IIB has demonstrated a healthy traction in operating performance over the past few quarters as it successfully braved the storm in late FY20 and FY21. It reported a loan growth of ~18% in 1QFY23 (vs average of 8% over FY20-22). Improving business activity and a recovery in its core CV and MFI segments will aid overall portfolio growth and further ease credit cost. We expect 18% loan CAGR over FY22-24. The management is strengthening its liability franchise, with an increased focus on garnering Retail deposits. The same has clocked 39% CAGR over FY20-22, while the mix, as per LCR disclosures, rose by ~1,000bp to 41%. Asset quality risks are receding, with a gradual reduction in stress from the MFI and CV book. The restructuring book too moderated to 2.1% of loans, which will keep slippages under control. The bank carries a healthy PCR of ~72% and a provision buffer of 1.2% of loans, which will result in a moderation in credit cost to 1.3% by FY24E. We have added IIB to our Model Portfolio, which was last published in Feb'22, and the stock has delivered ~26% returns since then. With key issues addressed, and steady progression in earnings along with improving growth momentum we expect the stock to re-rate further. We estimate FY24 RoA/RoE of 1.9%/15.7% and maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR1,450 (1.8x FY24E ABV). At 16:01 hrs IndusInd Bank was quoting at Rs 1,149.50, down Rs 33.70, or 2.85 percent.

    "article": "IndusInd Banks (IIBs) credit growth remains robust and in line with our expectations, at 18% YoY/5% QoQ in Q2FY23 which we believe is mainly driven by continued acceleration in the retail book (including MFI/CV) as well as the corporate book. On its MFI book (Bharat Financial, BFIL), the bank seems well poised for growth, with MFI as a sector being on the cusp of a growth-rebound, given asset-quality issues being largely behind and on-the-ground demand showing strong signs of pick-up. For IIB, entry into the higher-ticket individual MFI loan segment would also boost growth. Deposit growth too has been healthy for IIB, at 15% YoY/5% QoQ, unlike other banks, leading to nearly stable LDR at 82% in Q2. We expect margins to remain largely flattish in Q2, mainly due to flat LDR and repricing benefit to come with a lag owing to the banks relatively higher fixed-rate asset book. We expect slippages to remain elevated on account of relapse in the restructured pool, but NPA ratios to moderate from Q1 levels on the back of better recovery and accelerating credit growth. Bank is also well-provided with specific PCR at 72% and additional contingent provision buffer at 0.8% of loans which should keep incremental LLP in check and, thus, be the key profit driver, apart from credit growth. We believe the MFI saga is largely behind and the recent term extension for the MD by the Board puts to rest the uncertainty about current MD&CEO Sumant Kathpalias intention of continuing with the bank. We believe RBI approval for the MD re-appointment should not be a challenge, while re-accelerating credit growth, improving return ratios (13-16% over FY23-25E) and reasonable valuations (1.6x FY24E ABV) make IIB a compelling Buy . At 15:05 hrs IndusInd Bank was quoting at Rs 1,200.55, down Rs 18.65, or 1.53 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,234.65 and an intraday low of Rs 1,199.45.

On expected gross margins, it said, due to high inflation during the second quarter, the pressure on input costs has a short-term effect, but due to this, the operating margin is anticipated to be between 150 and 200 basis points lower than in Q2FY22 but to increase sequentially. \"During the quarter inflation was at peak levels which impacted gross margins. The input cost pressure led to a near-term impact on operating margin which is expected to be lower by around 150-200 bps as compared to Q2 FY22 but will see sequential improvement,\"   said in a regulatory filing. However, the company stated that its business in the country has been steady and the company is expected to report revenue growth in mid-single digits, despite the challenges posed by the macro-economic situation. The firm also said the unprecedented inflation led to weak demand trends across categories, adding urban markets driven by modern trade and e-commerce saw double-digit growth. And, as the rural market is concerned, the consumer goods major stated that it has witnessed some pressure in terms of liquidity, but is optimistic going forward, saying if inflation moderates, the festive season should support consumption growth. It has said the Food & Beverages sector continues to lead with strong double-digit growth, due to its 43% growth in Q2FY22. The Home and Personal Care portfolio is expected to record mid-single-digit growth on a high base of 16.7 percent growth in Q2FY22. The healthcare vertical is anticipated to experience dampened performance during the quarter due to the large Covid base. As far as its international business is concerned, the company said there are expectations that it may post double-digit revenue growth in constant currency. However, in Turkey and Egypt, it said currency depreciation persisted during the quarter, negatively affecting the translated growth. The firm said it was gaining market share and outpacing category growth in most of the segments, both in the domestic and international markets. The company also mentioned that to achieve profitable and sustainable growth, it would continue to invest in Power Brands, Innovation, Digitization, A&P, distribution expansion, and a strong back end. While the company has shared its business update for the second quarter, the financial result for the July-September period is yet to be released."

He saw a multifold rise in cement demand in India on the back of record-breaking economic growth and the government's infrastructure creation push, which will give significant margin expansion. In a speech made at an event to mark the completion of the acquisition on September 17, the Adani Group founder and chairman said the ports-to-energy conglomerate has in a single stroke become the second largest cement manufacturer in the country. Adani Group last week completed buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms. Calling the acquisition historic, he said this buyout is India's largest ever inbound M&A transaction in the infrastructure and materials space and closed in a record time of 4 months. \"Our entry into this business is happening at a time when India is on the cusp of one of the greatest economic surges seen in the modern world,\" he said in the speech, which was released on Monday. Stating reasons for the foray into the cement space, he said while India is the second largest producer of cement in the world, its per capita consumption is just 250 kg compared to 1,600 kg of China. \"This is almost a 7x headroom for growth.\" Also, \"as several of the government's programmes gather momentum, the long-term average growth in cement demand is expected to be 1.2 to 1.5 times the GDP. We anticipate growing at twice this number,\" he said. With trillion-dollar investment planned in infrastructure and housing in the country, cement is an attractive \"adjacency to our infrastructure business, especially the group's ports and logistics business, green energy business, and the e-commerce platform being developed,\" he said. Adani Group's competency in driving operational efficiency will result in \"significant margin expansion to become the most profitable cement manufacturer in the country,\" he said. \"And we anticipate going from the current 70 million tonne capacity to 140 million tonne in next 5 years.\" On his group's growth philosophy, Adani, 60, said it is the belief in India's growth story. India will be a USD 25-30 trillion economy by 2050, which points to huge growth prospects, he said. The group is the world's largest solar power company and has committed USD 70 billion investment in clean energy business including green hydrogen, he said. Adani Group is the largest airport operator in the nation with 25 per cent of passenger traffic and 40 per cent of air cargo. It is the largest ports and logistics company in the country with a 30 per cent market share. \"We are India's largest integrated energy player spanning generation, transmission, distribution, LNG, LPG, city gas and piped gas distribution. Each of these businesses is growing at double-digit rates,\" he said. While the group has won some of the largest road contracts in the country and is on the way to becoming the largest player in this sector, a grand IPO of Adani Wilmar has made it the highest-valued FMCG company in the country. \"We have declared our path forward in multiple new sectors that include data centers, super apps, aerospace and defence, industrial clouds, metals, and petrochemicals,\" he said. \"Our finances are stronger than ever before, and we continue to raise billions of dollars from international markets and strategic partners to further accelerate our growth.\""

About the Indian FMCG industry, GCPL said it continued to remain soft during the quarter and rural markets witnessed slower growth compared to urban markets. \"However, with the moderation in inflationary pressures due to correction in commodity prices, and the monsoon largely being on track (apart for a few states), we expect consumption to improve in the second half of the year,\" it said.

    "article": " is likely to report a drop in net profit in the second quarter of this fiscal despite a rise in revenues due to a huge surge in operating costs led by petroleum coke and coal prices. Volumes and realisations are expected to be higher on a year-on-year basis, resulting in a growth in revenues in the July-September quarter, which is usually weak as construction activities slow down due to the monsoon. The cement major is likely to post a 55 per cent year-on-year drop in profit after tax (PAT) even as the revenues are seen rising 22 percent when it announces earnings for July-September 2022 on October 14. According to a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, the company is expected to report a standalone PAT of Rs 260 crore while clocking standalone revenues of Rs 3,917 crore in Q2. The company had posted a PAT of Rs 578 crore during the corresponding period of last year when its standalone revenues stood at Rs 3,206 crore. The net profit during the previous quarter of the current fiscal stood at Rs 316 crore on revenues of Rs 4,203 crore. Analysts expect Shrees cement volumes to grow 18 percent on year to 7.5 million tonne (MT) while on a sequential basis they are seen declining marginally by 1 percent. We estimate volume of 7.4 MT (+18.5 percent YoY, -0.7 percent QoQ) during the quarter, factoring seasonality and backended recovery in demand during the quarter, said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. The blended realisations are likely to improve 6-7 percent on year but compared to the previous quarter they are forecast to dip 4 percent due to lower exit prices and rollback of price hikes. Earlier Shree Cement was most efficient in managing operating costs, which gave it an edge over the competition. However, now the competition has caught up and the company seems to have lost that edge. The rise in petroleum coke and coal prices and use of high-cost inventory will severely impact the prospects of cement players in the country and consequently, for Shree Cement, the variable costs are likely to surge about 80 percent as compared to the previous year period. This would expand the operating costs per tonne by close to 24-28 percent. We expect the variable cost per tonne to increase by 82 percent YoY, resulting in a 28 percent rise in operating expenses per tonne, said a report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. As a result, cement earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per tonne are estimated to decline to Rs 780-850 per tonne, a decline of more than 40 percent YoY and a decline of more than 20 percent on a sequential basis. EBITDA margins are estimated to tank 1,200 basis points (bps) to 16 percent from the margin of 28 percent achieved during the same period last year. On a sequential basis, the EBITDA margins are down 350 bps from 19.5 percent recorded during the previous quarter. At 11.35 am, Shree Cement was trading at Rs 20,850, down Rs 162 on the National Stock Exchange. The stock is down 25 percent over the past one year and has lost 13 percent in the past one month."

The company has aggressively expanded its capacity to capitalize on the impending opportunity in the Packaging Film industry, with a shift in consumer buying behavior. We have analyzed the Packaging Film industry and the competitive intensity of SRF. The key highlights are as follows: Over the last seven years, SRF aggressively incurred a cumulative capex of INR32.3b on building its Packaging Film division, resulting in an industry leading revenue/EBIDTA CAGR of 21%/39%, followed by Polyplex Corporation (PPC) at 11%/24%. Global demand for Packaging Films is expected to be driven by low penetration of packaged food, higher adaptability of Flexible Packaging, rising trend toward easily recyclable packaging solutions, innovative packaging, and e-commerce. However, higher competitive intensity and additional capacity build up in the industry may pressurize industry profitability in the short term. While we expect the management to cash-in on these opportunities, we maintain our Neutral rating, given to its rich valuation, which has been priced into its near-term upside. At 17:30 SRF was quoting at Rs 2,573.10, down Rs 49.90, or 1.90 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,638.30 and an intraday low of Rs 2,560.40.

Lower slippages should clearly sustain over the medium term because of improvement in the corporate credit cycle. Credit cost (as a of percentage of avg. loans) was also at a multi-quarter low of 0.9% in Q1FY23, owing to accelerated provisions made in earlier quarters (PCR at ~76%) as well as lower slippages. Benign credit cost is likely to support earnings trajectory in the medium term. Credit cost guidance stands at 1.25-1.50% of advances versus 1.8% in FY22. Margins are expected to improve by 10-15 bps from FY22 as the bank is focusing on the higher-margin segment - mid-corporate loans, personal loans, and gold loans within the retail segment.

    "article": "Torrent Pharmas (TRP) has Rs 70bn (75% of total sales; including Curatio) worth of highly profitable branded formulation sales spread across India, Brazil and RoW markets. In the near term, Curatio acquisition will increase TRPs net debt and we see this acquisition as EPS dilutive. Post factoring in Curatio acquisition, our EPS for FY23 and FY24 stands reduced by ~5%.

Historically TRP have managed to integrate successfully Unichem and Elder acquisition which gives us comfort. We expect 18% EBITDA and 19% EPS CAGR over FY22-25E.
